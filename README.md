# Skyfood 2026: Sales Performance & Territory Intelligence (SPTI)

**"Bridging the Brazil-US Revenue Gap through Predictive Analytics"**

## Business Scenario

Skyfood Equipment LLC, a primary North American distributor for **Metalúrgica Skymsen**, manages a complex network of independent sales representatives. Operating in the high-stakes industrial kitchen equipment market, the company faced a significant visibility challenge: the inability to distinguish between market-driven territory failure and individual representative performance issues.

## The Business Problem

The "***Miami Gap***" represents **$257,100 in uncaptured revenue** for Q1 2026. Prior to this project, management relied on lagging indicators that failed to identify ***why*** certain territories were underperforming. High lead volumes were being squandered in some regions, while others lacked the inventory velocity to meet 2026 product catalog goals.

## Project Objectives & Scope

* **Revenue Protection:** Identify and mitigate "At-Risk" revenue through early-warning statistical flags.
* **Resource Optimization:** Reallocate lead-generation budgets based on "Revenue per Lead" efficiency.
* **Inventory Alignment:** Synchronize sales velocity for high-demand units (e.g., INT90S Tenderizer) with Miami warehouse capacity.
* **The In-House Case:** Demonstrate how internal data ownership reduces the $34k+ "Bill McCoy Risk" through immediate, data-driven intervention.

## Tech Stack & Methodology

* **Python:** Engineered Z-Score models and correlation matrices to identify performance outliers.
* **Google BigQuery:** Developed a robust SQL warehouse layer to automate metric aggregation and strategic status tagging.
* **Looker Studio:** Designed a 3-tier Executive Command Center for real-time diagnostic storytelling.

## Strategic Insights & Conclusions

* **The Conversion Crisis:** The analysis revealed that **Bill McCoy Associates** and **Hybrid Marketing** are not "lead-starved" but "conversion-challenged," holding the lowest statistical performance scores (Z-Score -1.46) despite high lead counts.
* **Inventory Pressure:** The **INT90S Tenderizer** is identified as a high-velocity outlier (95% attainment), requiring an immediate replenishment order from the Brazil factory to prevent stock-outs.
* **Root Cause Discovery:** Discovered that **Diettrich Sales**’ underperformance is a "Low Pipeline" issue (11 leads), not a skill issue, suggesting a need for increased marketing support in their territory.
